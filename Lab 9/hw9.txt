The first step is to check out version 3.0 into a new branch called "quote". We can do
this through the command git checkout v3.0 -b quote, from within the diffutils
directory. Then I installed my patch through the command patch -p1 <
quote-3.0-patch.txt, which had the following output:

patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/context.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

This indicates that the patch process was successful. Then I opened quote-3.0-patch.txt
in Emacs, and used the command C-x 4 a in order to write a ChangeLog entry. I then
committed this change to the branch using the command git commit -F ChangeLog, so that
the ChangeLog entry was the commit message.

Now we have to generate our formatted patch. To do this, the first step is to determine
the hex value for my commit, which I found out through git log was
c2f0b3d763064438ad846661ced8770f6303b79c. I then used the command git format-patch -1
--stdout c2f0b3d763064438ad846661ced8770f6303b79c > formatted-patch.txt, and this
created the file formatted-patch.txt, which is my patch.

I then emailed this over to my partner, and he emailed me his patch for the next part.
The first step was to use the command git checkout v3.0 -b partner, to create a new
branch for testing the patch. I then copied his patch over, and used the command
git am < formatted-patch.txt. This worked succesfully, and through git log I was able to
view the contents of his patch which are below:

        * quote-3.0-patch.txt:
        * src/cmp.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
        * src/diff.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
        * src/diff3.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
        * src/dir.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
        * src/sdiff.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """
        * src/util.c: Changing all of the "`" to "'" and """

Now I can build the system through the commands ./bootstrap, ./configure, and make. Then
I run make check to ensure everything is working as expected. Finally to confirm
everything has worked, I used the command make distdir, which creates a directory that
contains my partner's patch. I then view the ChangeLog, and get the same output as the
log, which confirms that my partner's patch was successful.

The final step was to obtain the gitk screenshot and write the description. To do this
I first logged into the linux server with the -X option, and then ran gitk within the
directory ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs. This opened up a window, and I then took a screenshot
and wrote the description.
