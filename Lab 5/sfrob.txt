Performance Comparison
Name: Anirudh Veeraragavan

The first comparison is between sfrob and sfrobu on inputs of varying
input lines. The two inputs I used were two files, input1.txt and
input2.txt, which contained 355 and 424 input lines respectively. I used
the time command to measure how long each program took, and the results
are as follows:
		input1.txt		input2.txt
sfrob	real	0.003s			0.005s
	user	0.001s			0.003s
	sys	0.001s			0.002s
	
sfrobu	real	0.010s			0.015s
	user	0.003s			0.002s
	sys	0.007s			0.011s

Thus we can clearly see that sfrob runs faster than sfrobu. Furthermore
we can use the strace command to estimate the number of comparisons
as a function of input lines. For sfrobu it appears to be a one-to-one,
which makes sense since every byte is being read one at a time. For sfrob
it appears to be roughly 1 comparison for every 3500 characters; however,
this does not really hold for files of small characters.

The last comparison is between sfrob, sfrobu, sfrobs, sfrobu -f, and
sfrobs -f. For this comparison I will simply use one input file and
measure how long each variation takes. The results are as follows:

	sfrob	   sfrobu     sfrobs     sfrobu -f     sfrobs -f
real	0.003	   0.008      0.008	 0.008	       0.006
user	0.001	   0.001      0.003	 0.003	       0.002
sys	0.001	   0.006      0.007	 0.005	       0.006

Thus we can clearly see that sfrob is the fastest. Additionally while the
-f flag makes no real difference for sfrobu, it appears to make sfrobs
run slighty faster. Finally sfrobu and sfrobs appear to run at a similar
speed.
