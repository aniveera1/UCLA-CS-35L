Question 1:
Brady removed that line in an attempt to clean up code because the line was
duplicated right above as case long_iso_time_style:. Thus that line is not
necessary, and removing it is also not necessary but he removed it to clean up
the code in that switch statement a bit.

Question 2:
There are a few problems the patched version of Coreutils might pose. First of
all in countries where the average user does not speak English they may not be
able to understand the date format since it relies on the English spelling of
the months. Additionally if the user is not proficient in English they may
also not be able to recognize the abbreviations that the format uses for the
various months. A non-English speaking user could easily confuse Jan with Jun
and so on. Finally the version relies on the English date format of
month-day-year, which many countries around the world do not use.

Question 3:
When this script is invoked on an empty file with a numlines parameter greater
than 0, the script throws an IndexError since there are no lines for the
script to choose from so it gets an out of range error. The only time this
error does not happen is when the numlines parameter is 0, but that is
equivalent to not doing anything.

Question 4:
The script does not work with Python 3 because of the error:
File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
The script appears to be using some features of Python 2 that were deprecated
in Python 3.
