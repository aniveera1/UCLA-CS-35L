Laboratory Log
The first step is to download Coreutils 7.6, and we can do this by simply
downloading the tar.gz file locally to our machine and then using the command
scp to send it to the linux server. After it is in the linux server, we create
a new directory, coreutilsInstall. 

Now we unzip and untar the file using the command
tar â€“xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz This command decompresses all the files into a
new directory called coreutils-7.6. Now we change into this new directory and
read the INSTALL file in order to learn how to configure, make and install
all these source files.

The first step is to configure the files, and to do that we can use the command
./configure --prefix=/w/home.13/cs/ugrad/veerarag/coreutilsInstall
which will configure all the files and install them in the directory
coreutilsInstall. This process takes a decent amount of time, and once it has
finished we can use the command make to compile all of the files. Finally we
use the command make install, and once it has finished coreutils-7.6 has been
installed on our system.

To test this we change to the directory coreutilsInstall and use the command
./bin/ls -l, which will run the version of ls in coreutils-7.6. When we observe
the output the dates are formatted as 2017-04-18 11:09, which is the exact
bug that we were looking for. One thing to note is that if we had simply run
ls -l, we would not have gotten the bug because the version of ls that was run
would not have been the one in coreutils-7.6.

Now we need to patch this bug. We do this by changing to the coreutils-7.6
directory and using the command vim patch_file to create a new file. This file
will contain our patch content, which we copy and paste from Brady's email.
Now we use man patch to learn about this command, and the -pnum option. After
doing so we use the command patch -p1 < patch_file, which will patch ls.c. The
reason we use this command is because it will simply modify the ls.c file to
account for the new additions, and not rewrite the whole thing.

Now we type make to rebuild the patched ls.c file, and it is important to note
that only a few files were modified because not all the files are going to be
affected by a change to ls.c. We do not install because we do not want to
overwrite the buggy ls file, and if we change to our home directory we can test
the output of both.

For seeing the output of the modified ls file we run the command
./coreutils-7.6/src/ls -l, and this gives us the date formatted properly
in traditional Unix date. For seeing the output of the buggy ls file we run the
command ./coreutilsInstall/bin/ls -l, and this gives us the YYYY-MM-DD date
format, which is wrong.

Some sample output for the correct ls file include:
drwxr-xr-x  2 veerarag csugrad     4096 Jan 31 12:09 test17
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad        0 Apr 13 10:55 test.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad        0 Apr 11 11:11 tr
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad  4953680 Apr 11 14:35 words
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad     9316 Apr 13 11:05 words.txt
Some sample output for the buggy ls file include:
drwxr-xr-x  2 veerarag csugrad     4096 2017-01-31 12:09 test17
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad        0 2017-04-13 10:55 test.txt
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad        0 2017-04-11 11:11 tr
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad  4953680 2017-04-11 14:35 words
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad     9316 2017-04-13 11:05 words.txt

Now we test our ls commands on files that are older than one year. We can do
this through the touch command, and we shall change three files to be older
than 1 year. The three commands are touch -t 201401210959.30 tr,
touch -t 201401210959.30 words, and touch -t 201401210959.30 words.txt.

Now when we run the commands we see that for the buggy output, there is no
significant difference except the date was changed to the one specified in the
touch command. However, for the modified ls file there is a difference as the
year is specified for these three files. It thus appears that in traditional
UNIX date format the year is only specified if the file is older than one year.

Some output for the modified ls file:
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad        0 Jan 21  2014 tr
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad  4953680 Jan 21  2014 words
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad     9316 Jan 21  2014 words.txt
Some output for the buggy ls file:
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad        0 2014-01-21 09:59 tr
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad  4953680 2014-01-21 09:59 words
-rw-r--r--  1 veerarag csugrad     9316 2014-01-21 09:59 words.txt
